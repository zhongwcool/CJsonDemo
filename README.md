How to process json data in c language

# Reference

[CJson](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) is an opensource project on GitHub.

Welcome to [CJson](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON).

cJSON aims to be the dumbest possible parser that you can get your job done with. It's a single file of C, and a single
header file.

JSON is described best here: http://www.json.org/
It's like XML, but fat-free. You use it to move data around, store things, or just generally represent your program's
state.
